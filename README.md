# OS-Homeworks
A repository featuring my OS homeworks

These programs require you to run them on a Linux/Mac environment as they make use of system calls such as fork, pipefd, mutexes, and client/server connection calls. They will need to be run from the command prompt using input redirection from a file. This file should follow the format of the file described in each homeworks respective PDF instruction file.

# An example of compiling and running from terminal:

$ cpp scheduler.cpp -o main

$ ./main < input.txt

# Homework 1
Makes use of the fork system call

# Homework 2
Makes use of the fork and pipe system calls, as well as includes client & server programs

You will need to compile each program separately and run them on two terminal windows (or one if you know how)

# Homework 3
Makes use of mutual exclusions (mutexes), conditional variables and posix semaphores
